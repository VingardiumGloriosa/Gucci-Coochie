Customer feedback log (Aisté K.)

On December 15th we had our first customer meeting upon which we delivered them our paper prototype designed by Chiara and website prototype designed by Glória. 
We had explained the process and plans for further iterations and this is what we recieved as feedback.

As a huge cat lover who is currently searching for the perfect companion, I couldn’t be more excited about ‘Catinder’. 
After watching the presentation made by Pirates I can’t wait to use the app and website. 
Currently the task of looking for a cat to adopt is quite daunting because I have to go through millions of different ugly websites. 
With ‘Catinder’ my search will be much easier, enjoyable, and personal. 
The only issue I see is that it might be difficult to tell which cats are actually for adoption so I might fall in love with one that already has a home. However, I’m sure the team will be able to come up with something that will fix this small issue.

Based on this feedback we have implemented a symbol overlay on cats that are available for adoption. This way the customer can simply distinguish between cats and avoid heartache.
We showed this solution to our customer to which she is currently satisfied with the product.
